# multichoose
Multichoose is a way to choose items, where *n* is the number of items to choose from and *k* is the sets of items to choose. Order is not important, and repeats are allowed.

For example, 4 multichoose 2 is the number of possible ways to choose a set of 2 items from a group of 4 different items. The solution is 10 and the combinations are {1,1}, {1,2}, {1,3}, {1,4}, {2,2}, {2,3}, {2,4}, {3,3}, {3,4} and {4,4}.

Python code for listing all combinations of *n* multichoose *k* and returns the list of all possible combinations (multisets).
